Summary

When I first started to learn HTML and CSS, Javascript seemed to far and complex to decipher. Having worked on this 
digital clock app for a couple weeks now, I can say it is definitely a challenge. A challenege that is rewarding and leaves you wanting more.
A building block that will serve its purpose.
